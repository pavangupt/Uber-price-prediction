# Uber-price-prediction
This project is about the world's largest taxi company Uber. In this projects, i will predict the fare for their future transactional cases.  We don’t even remember having to be refused a ride in the dead of the night or on late evenings. All this – and much more, with the advent of online cab providers, through which a user can book a ride in a matter of a few minutes.Since, enourmous people are using this cab servcive so it is important to manage the data, which result into benefitting them by implementing other business ideas.
This Dataset contains following fields:
1)Key:- A unique id(Identifier) for each passenger
2)fare_amount:- The cost of the trip
3)pickup_datetime:- the time of pickup the passenger
4)passenger_count - The number of passengers in the vehicle (driver entered value)
5)pickup_longitude - the longitude where the meter was engaged
6)pickup_latitude - the latitude where the meter was engaged
7)dropoff_longitude - the longitude where the meter was disengaged
8)dropoff_latitude - the latitude where the meter was disengaged

Objectives:-  1) Understanding the dataset and preprocessing it
              2) Building various regression model to find optimal solution
              3)Evaluating the model using parameters such as mse, r2, rmse etc.
